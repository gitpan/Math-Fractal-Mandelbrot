Module to calculate Mandelbrot fractal points efficiently

(C) ..--- ----- ----- ...-- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

How to install (replace the version below with the current one):

	tar -xzf Math-Fractal-Mandelbrot-0.01.tar.gz
	cpansign --verify

If the signature does not verify ok, you might to install Module::Signature
and get my key from <http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc>.

If the signature still does not verify okay, notify me. DO NO INSTALL this
package when the signature is BAD - your system might get compromised!

If the signature is good, do:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

and then as root:

	make install

Look for SDL-App-FPS on search.cpan.org for a demo application using this
module.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
