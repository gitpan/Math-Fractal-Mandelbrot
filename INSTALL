Module to calculate Mandelbrot Fractals

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

First: you need to install Module::Signature, if you haven't already.

Then get my key (http://bloodgate.com/tels.asc) and unwrap this package, then
verify the contents by:

	cpansign --verify

If the signature is valid, proceed. If the signature is B<NOT> valid, do 
B<NOT> proceed. Your system might get compromies. Please inform me ASAP.

When the signature was okay:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If not all tests passed, please inform me.

This module is used by an example inside the SDL::App::FPS package, make sure
you check it out to see the Mandelbrot Fractal in action :)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
